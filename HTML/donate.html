	  <center><h4>Giving is not just about making a donation, its about making a difference</h4></center>
      <br>
        <p>
          1. Stray dogs don’t get the nutrition they need, and sometimes don’t even have food to eat. Your donated food will give them needed nutrients and health. <br> <br>
          2. Stray dogs always depend on the leftovers from the restaurant or thrown raw food but these aren't enough for them to maintain their health and so it is necessary to feed them proper dog food. <br> <br>
          3. A little amount of donation from individuals helps the organization to feed more and more dogs every day and spreading happiness all around.

            <b>We ensure 100% transparency because you deserve to know when, where, and how your donations are bringing a change in who's life. Sponsor a meal for some dogs and we will share with you a picture of a meal marked with your name on it.</b> <br> <br>
            <b>We request you to bring the dog food to the food drives after registering for it. You can check our <a href="Volunteer.html">Food Drives</a> schedule.</b>
