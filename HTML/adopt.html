      <p><h4>1. You learn responsibility</h4>
      Rescuing a stray dog ​​or adopting from a shelter is a decision that should not be taken lightly, and that compromises you for the rest of the animal's life.<br>
      <h4>2. You save lives</h4>
      Adopting a street dog will save their life, giving them a second chance to have a home and live a dignified and happy life.<br>
      <h4>3. Fights against the buying and selling of living beings</h4>
      When buying a dog in a pet store or from a breeder, you contribute to the breeding, legal or not, of animals, and in most cases this is done in poor conditions for poor dogs and do not support the abuse.<br>
      <h4>4. You earn a friend for life</h4>
      If you have ever felt isolated, after you have adopted a dog you will never feel alone again.<br>
      <h4>5. You will always be protected</h4>
